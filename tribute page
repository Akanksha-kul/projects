      <h3> <u>Quotes by Neil deGrasse Tyson</u></h3>
    <blockquote><p>
      The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
    </p>
    <cite id="cite">-- Neil deGrasse Tyson</cite>
    <p>
      We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.</p>
    <cite>-- Neil deGrasse Tyson</cite>
    <p>
      Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.</p>
    <cite>-- Neil deGrasse Tyson</cite>
